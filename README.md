# 🧠 Online Quiz Application

An interactive web-based quiz application that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions based on **category** and **difficulty level**, with a **timer for each question**, immediate feedback, and a final score summary.

> ✅ Developed as part of my internship with [TechnoHacks Edutech](https://technohacks.co.in/) under the guidance of **Mentor Sandip Gavit**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Category and Difficulty Filtering** – Users can select specific topics and levels.
- ⏱ **Per-Question Timer** – Each question has a countdown (e.g., 15 seconds); auto-submits when time runs out.
- ✅ **Submit and Next Controls** – Answer checking and navigation per question.
- 📊 **Score Summary** – Shows result with correct and incorrect answers after quiz completion.
- 💡 **Instant Feedback** – Answers are highlighted green/red upon submission.
- 📡 **RESTful APIs** – Built using Express.js and JSON data backend.
